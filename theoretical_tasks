What is a Factory Pattern?

goal: seperate creation from use,
-> so you can use the object without knowing how exactly it's created and that makes it more flexible to change
the object later on - without having to change the code that is using it.
-> also this makes it easier to use objects created at runtime ( for example by user input)
factory: creates the object - usually all objects created in a factory have the same parent / or superclass -
which defines which methods and attributes the object needs to have

How would you design a generic CSV importer for multiple CSV files? Each CSV file contains three columns
with data (date, power, wind speed). The column headers are slightly different for each file. The date
format and timezone is different for each file.

If the columns are always in the same order, the different header names shouldn’t pose a problem,
I would set the names [date, power, wind speed] and use them when importing the data into the DB.
The different date format and timezone can be handled by the dateutil library. But the safer way would
be probably to define the dateformat for each file and parse it as a variable.


How would you find and fix a bug which occurs only for some data points in some date ranges?

Finding: by visualization
Fixing:
with try catch except
Probably it’s better to fix the bugs when reading the data, so the raw data isn’t changed.
