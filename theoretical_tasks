How would you design a generic CSV importer for multiple CSV files? Each CSV file contains three columns
with data (date, power, wind speed). The column headers are slightly different for each file. The date
format and timezone is different for each file.

If the columns are always in the same order, the different header names shouldn’t pose a problem,
I would set the names [date, power, wind speed] and use them when importing the data into the DB.
The different date format and timezone can be handled by the dateutil library. But the safer way would
be probably to define the dateformat for each file and parse it as a variable.


How would you find and fix a bug which occurs only for some data points in some date ranges?

Finding: by using try – catch – except
Fixing: Probably it’s better to fix the bugs when reading the data, so the raw data isn’t changed.
